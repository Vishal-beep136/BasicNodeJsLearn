        Thomas Edison began his career selling candy, newspapers and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to
        Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and
        chemical experiments. He became a telegraph operator after he saved 3-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being
        struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so
        grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was
        at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway. He was held responsible for a near collision. He
        also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.

        Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set
        in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers. timately, his
        entrepreneurship was central to the formation of some 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the
        largest publicly traded companies in the world.

        In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he
        worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time
        to spend at his two favorite pastimesâ€”reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him
        his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead-acid battery when he spilt sulfuric acid onto the floor.
        It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.

        His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869.
        Finding little demand for the machine, Edison moved to New York City shortly thereafter. One of his mentors
        during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the
        impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home, while Edison worked for
        Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded their own company in October 1869, working as
        electrical engineers and inventors. Edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two
        messages simultaneously, in 1874.
